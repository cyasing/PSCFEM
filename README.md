# PSCFEM
A rudimentary individual level 1-D FEM code for simulating a perovskite Solar Cell (PSC), obtaining a J-V curve at the end.

The code is given in the PSCFEM.mlx file. The MATLAB Live Script format helps me explain my though process and understanding while having a working code with it, better than simply commenting.

It is an incomplete code, with only the esential concepts of FEM implemeted in as simple a way as possible. The code will be completed in the future, (hopefully within the next 12 months) with proper math and algorithms implemented.

I have to leave it incomplete for the time being because it took me too much time to figure out open source codes on FEM and PSC simulation (my first time reading open source codes), and I must move on to prevent stagnation.
